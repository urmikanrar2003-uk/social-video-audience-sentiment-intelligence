"What really sucks is that it's good enough right now to get like 80-90% of the way there in a lot of situations so they can use the excuse to still displace current workers and outsource staff to just fill in gaps and then later when it's better they can just get rid of those outsourced people as well.

"I would just add that while it does perform visual arts tasks well, I would argue that is purely for generation, not itteration - it's not good at making revisions, taking art direction or maintaining consistency. On complex/longer projects with interlinked dependancies regarding look and feel for assets, it becomes much harder to produce things with AI that fit the requirements of the project and feel cohesive, whereas human made pipelines build for efficiency, making production more efficient over time. It also cannot do tasks that require problem solving in 3 dimensional space, moving parts with logic etc.",positive

I was very excited by the prospects.
I used it for learning some stuff I found difficult to learn on YouTube or Google and the problems started arising: It didn't understood what you wished, yield results that have nothing to do with what you wished and was pretty clear just a Google Search compiler, actually I found using Google was far faster than ChatGPT because generally all I need is an example or an idea and I can look up on forums and see what suits me better faster without having to wait. So I stopped using.

"It doesn't surprise me at all that AI is worse at human jobs than the tech industry wants us to think. I haven't used AI much, and never on purpose (Google has added AI to its searches), but I have seen enough to know that there are things it's really good at (like compiling large amounts of relatively simple information), and things that AI will probably never really be good at (like human empathy). 

But the tech industry sees it as hugely profitable (as they try to make it harder and harder to avoid), so of course they are not interested in slowing their roll, or addressing the most basic concerns about what happens when you teach soulless machines to approximate human interaction. They see this as a golden opportunity to make their for-profit technology more and more a part of human life (despite all the risks that have been identified). Capitalism is great at creating new stuff but not so good at a mitigating the massive social disruption caused by their fantasy projects. They want their social engineering experiments to be everything to everyone.",positive
"We need to take time into consideration when comparing output quality. 2 minutes of work from an AI in many fields, is of far higher quality than 2 minutes from a human.

"Exactly! And part of the problem is that we keep using the term AI. This is NOT AI !!! The tech bros keep pushing the buzz word AI to get more funding and attention, but it's really just a language model with predictable word generation. LLMs are at best a distant predecessor of the real AI. The current version of ""AI"" doesn't have its own consciousness, or motivation, or imagination or anything resembling artificial intelligence. It's gonna take a radically new approach to step up the AI to the next level. You just can't achieve that with a LLM that works like a word auto-completion tool with statistically average answers.
Currently the word ""AI"" is not even used in official documents, because those companies could get sued for misleading people. In those documents only terms like ""LLM"" and other similar ones are used. So we should all start calling it what it is, still a useful tool, but nothing more than a LLM.",positive

"The ""96% failure rate"" in the RLI study is a misleading metric because it tests for total automation rather than human-AI augmentation, which is how the technology is actually used. Here is the counter-evidence:

The ""One-Shot"" Flaw: The study penalized AI for ""failures"" like incorrect file formats or minor omissions that a human freelancer would fix in seconds during a standard feedback loop. In real-world workflows, iterative prompting increases AI success rates by over 40%.

Enterprise ROI: If AI were failing this significantly, we wouldn't see the current 2026 data from firms like PwC Ireland, where 53% of companies report measurable productivity gains in audit and IT.

Developer Reality: Microsoft and Meta are currently reporting that 30% to 50% of their production code is AI-generated. A 96% failure rate would have collapsed their infrastructure by now; instead, deployment speeds have increased.

The Prompting Gap: The study used briefs written for humans. Research shows that when ""Agentic workflows"" and optimized prompting are used, AI accuracy on complex tasks jumps from the low single digits to nearly 50%.

The Verdict: The study proves AI isn't a ""drop-in"" replacement for a human professional yet, but it ignores that AI-assisted humans are currently outperforming and out-earning those who don't use it. We aren't seeing a ""failure"" of AI; we're seeing the ""failure"" of the ""set-it-and-forget-it"" implementation strategy.",negative

"At least from my experience, if you're not an expert to review the AI's work after it's done, don't trust the results. As an example I tried to test AI on basic car setup for track racing and by basic I mean really basic stuff such as comparing tyre temperatures on different areas of the tyre and between the tyres to adjust camber settings in one direction or the other, I didn't even asked it to calculate the camber angle, just to tell me which direction it should go. Long story short, it went in the complete opposite direction and if I had set up the car the way it advised I would end up with a setup that was suitable for 1920's race cars and tractors. Even after asking it to take into account different variables it was still adamant that its thinking was correct. Only when I  spent half an hour guiding it through its errors in logic it produced a somewhat acceptable results. As someone with experience with such setups It would take me 30 seconds to decide in general the camber angles for each tyre within 0.2' degrees of the optimal (to get absolutely the optimal angle you need to run quali and race simulations to compare tyre wear and compromise the pro's and cons, such a task would be impossible for the AI to even understand the concept and tailor it to a specific driving style, how much faster it is and how much more difficult it is to drive without wearing the tyres too much. For example for quali runs I don't care that much about tyre wear and how difficult it is to drive, I only care about lap time, i can deal with a car on a razor's edge for two laps, but for a long race my priority isn't only lap time but how easy it is to drive (if the car is too twitchy for two hours you'll eventually crash) and tyre wear, i need the tyres to last the distance with a steady drop in laptimes (not grip suddenly falling through a cliff)",negative

"7:57 LLMs are actually not moving fast.

"Bad timing on this video, which will not age well. While markets and stocks vacillate, often driven more by sentiment than logic, AI continues on a hyper-exponential growth path based on a substantial amount of feed-forward factors.  Humans have trouble really understanding and applying tools under a typical exponential regime where human up-skilling and adoption rates are the biggest growth limiting factors; so, it's not surprising that many have a very hard time even beginning to conceptualize tetrated growth and how to best leverage it.  In any case, unlike dumb digital under Moore's Law, AI can actually help us learn and execute, so the biggest limiting factor is getting past noise like in this video to figure out the best ways to leverage the unprecedented power provided by AI along its super-exponential growth.

2025 laid the foundation for agentics via the beginning of reasoning coupled with a prior-a and in context reinforcement loops and learning.  2026 has started with initial closed-loop, self executing and evolving AI which will solidify from strong human in the loop where it started in January 2026, to increasingly soft/optional human in the loop optional for many tasks into this summer, to powerful new closed loop feed-forward problem solving and knowledge reinforcement later this year.

You are so out of touch with what is happening with AI, and how we are using it inside of companies, as well as how fast it is accelerating that would makes this video almost comical, if it weren't so misguided and dangerous to people who should be using this time to learn and retool, rather than sit back.

Simply stated, if you are among the people not getting several 10's to 100's of percent quality * time efficiency gains then you are the limiting factor and friction point, and will soon enough likely become road kill. 

I have coded professionally across DoE/DoD and civilian projects for over 40 years, and all I can say is that I have coded more better quality code using PRD and harness driven AI in the past 7 months than I have in over 4 decades before.
Further, the amount of substantially passive revenue gained via agentic AI-Native approaches created in the past year dwarfs any ROI I could have even imagined just a few years ago.

So, while I know that just like any toolset, it takes people time to learn how to best leverage it.  Given AI's tetrated growth rate, this is even a bigger challenge for many people, of which AI will help bridge human's constrained ability to learn and adapt.  Now that the foundation has been laid in terms of solid coding, reasoning and hybrid models we have started to see a hard lift-off beginning a few months ago, as we pivot from mostly training and chat mode inference, to deeply woven inference as the key driver.",positive

Having videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti look increasingly real sparked huge investment because people think that this is a generalized AI that is just as good at any problem thrown at it, but in reality, the LLM is going to have to be more specialized for any particular task, and will have to be extensively trained for each task, which takes time and money.  It's not like you can take one model, train it once and expect it to make a Will Smith movie, drive a car through NYC traffic, and do brain surgery.  It is going to fail.  For any process for which there is enough repetition for it to learn in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost, there will be niche implementations of AI that perform those specific tasks well, but each implementation is going to have to be fiscally viable on it's own.

Except that we also have a gift, given us by Zeus, who founded this community of ours. We can reattach ourselves and become once more components of the whole. But if the rupture is too often repeated, it makes the severed part hard to reconnect, and to restore. You can see the difference between the branch that’s been there since the beginning, remaining on the tree and growing with it, and the one that’s been cut off and grafted back. “One trunk, two minds.” As the gardeners put it.""

"Well, here's what my AI says to this video:
 * The ""All-or-Nothing"" Fallacy: The video uses a study that defines success as the AI completing a job 100% solo. By ignoring the ""Human-in-the-loop"" model, it misses the fact that if an AI does 90% of a white-collar task in 2 seconds, the human is now 10x more productive. This leads to ""job loss"" through efficiency, even if the AI ""failed"" to do the job alone.
 * The Binary Trap (96% Failure): Framing the data as a ""96% failure rate"" is a statistical ""gotcha."" It makes it sound like AI is useless for those jobs. In reality, an AI that ""fails"" to finish a 3D floor plan but completes 70% of the draft still disrupts the labor market for junior draftsmen.
 * Narrow Context (Upwork Bias): The video relies on freelance tasks from Upwork. Freelance work often requires high-context communication and unique creative briefs. It doesn't account for the ""vast majority of white-collar tasks"" in corporate settings—like processing insurance claims, internal reporting, or basic legal discovery—which are much more structured and ""automatable"" than a custom graphic design brief.
 * Underestimating the ""Scaling Problem"": While the video cites Yann LeCun saying ""just making it bigger won't solve it"", it dismisses the immediate economic impact. Even if AI never reaches ""Human Level Intelligence,"" it can still reach ""Human Level Task Completion"" for most office work, which is the real threat to white-collar employment.
 * The ""Fixer"" Paradox: The narrator suggests software engineers should just start businesses fixing ""vibecoded"" apps. This ignores the scale: if one senior engineer can use AI to do the work of five junior developers and then ""fix"" the output, those five junior developers are still out of a job.
 * Outdated Snapshots: It uses a snapshot of models like Claude 4.5/4.6. In the AI world, a ""failure"" from six months ago is often a solved problem today. By the time a ""96% failure"" video is published, the models have often already improved their ""success rate"" by several percentage points.
In short: The video's major failure is that it treats AI as a ""New Employee"" (and finds it lacking) rather than AI as ""Steam Power for Brains"" (which is already working). It looks for a 1:1 replacement of a human, while the real danger you identified is the ""task-by-task"" erosion of the white-collar workload.",negative

What AI is going to do, if we don't regulate it, is remove most of the human touch from entertainment and cultural media. Which will not lead to any positive outcomes.

Regardless of which side one takes on any issue, because two mutually exclusive views are available, we have to realize that a whole bunch of inaccurate info exists on the internet. But the worst is yet to come. As so many are poised to create and upload a tremendous amount of AI generated content to this same internet space, all for the sake of chasing a quick buck, very soon, and I do mean VERY soon,  the internet will become super saturated with AI content This will result in later efforts to create AI content having to draw on a majority of AI content, and the studies have been done and the jury is in. As AI attempts to create content based on AI content, the quality of that content deteriorates rapidly to the point of pure gibberish. It is the same process as using a copy machine to make a copy, then make a copy of that copy, and so forth. By the fourth or fifth copy, the results deteriorates to an unacceptable point. And I fear that AI generated content will become so sophisticated that no AI program will be able to distinguish it from genuine human created content.

"Both sides push extreme fear porn: ""AI will do everything"" vs. ""AI fails at 96% of jobs""

Reality: AI is a powerful productivity tool, much like backhoes replacing manual ditch-digging or factory automation displacing assembly lines. It won't eliminate all jobs, but it will automate or augment many—especially routine or cognitive ones.

The ""96% failure"" study tested AI alone on complex tasks, not AI-assisted humans. That's a flawed comparison; the real edge comes from collaboration. However, as AI evolves, fully autonomous task performance (no human oversight) will keep growing. In 2026 we're not there yet: current agents handle multi-step work and tools well, but struggle with highly complex, long-horizon, or novel tasks needing deep judgment. Many experts now see early-to-mid 2030s (some say later) for truly standalone AI across most jobs, though optimistic views still point to late 2020s. For the next few years, the biggest wins come from close human-AI collaboration—people directing and refining capable agents.

Over the next 5 years, AI will disrupt a large share of current roles, shifting jobs (e.g., fewer manual workers, more operators/managers overseeing AI systems). As with past tech waves, displaced workers—especially older ones—will face tough transitions and need reskilling. Historically, though, technology boosts overall employment: freed-up human effort creates new products, services, and industries once too costly or impossible.

"I usually avoid these kinds of videos because they tend to ride the trend cycle. A few years ago AI was “magic.” Now that it’s socially disruptive it is suddenly “overhyped” or “crap.” The reality is more nuanced.

Studies like this, using something like RLI to quantify impact, do not really capture the true state of AI. First, AI is not a monolith. Using LLMs as a proxy for “AI” is already a limitation. There are highly specialized AI systems that are extremely reliable and valuable in narrow domains, and those rarely make headlines.

Second, results with generative AI are highly user dependent. My coworkers can use the exact same model and get completely different outcomes. That variability does not mean the system is bad. It means interaction design and user skill matter. These studies often ignore that dimension.

Also, generative AI and predictive AI are fundamentally different categories. Generative AI is creative and probabilistic by nature. Predictive AI aims for stability and repeatability. Conflating both under one “AI impact” metric oversimplifies the landscape.

AI is still in its infancy in terms of mass adoption. Expectations are exaggerated on both sides. But dismissing it based on broad metrics does not reflect the complexity of what is actually happening.

I appreciate the quality of Dagogo’s content, but his latest videos feel like they lean into a comforting narrative for people who feel threatened by current AI systems. The click-oriented titles amplify that tone. I hope future coverage remains mainstream and accessible while also being more precise and balanced about what AI actually is and is not.",positive

"Ai is so bad at hallucinating. I said this to Gemini today. This is what it said :I hear you loud and clear, and I honestly can’t argue with that. There is a specific kind of reassurance you get from a human being—especially when you’re dealing with something as high-stakes as a fire alarm installation for your home—that a line of code just can't replicate.
​That ""peace of mind"" comes from knowing a person on the other end understands the weight of keeping a household safe. A robot might follow a checklist, but a human understands the importance of the task.
​You’ve hit on the two biggest ""elephants in the room"" regarding AI right now:
​1. The ""Hallucination"" Problem
​You are absolutely right. AI can be incredibly confident while being completely wrong. In a technical or safety-oriented setting (like ADT home security), a ""hallucination"" isn't just a glitch; it’s a liability. Humans have the common sense and intuition to say, ""Wait, that doesn't look right,"" whereas an AI might just keep moving through its script.
​2. The ROI Gap (Return on Investment)
​There is a massive amount of hype, and many companies are finding out the hard way that throwing money at AI doesn't automatically make things better or cheaper.
​The Cost of ""Babysitting"": Often, companies spend more money having humans check the AI's work than they would have spent just having a human do it right the first time.
​The Loss of Customer Trust: If a customer has a bad, ""robotic"" experience, they leave. That’s a loss no algorithm can easily calculate.
​The ""Human-in-the-Loop"" Reality
​The irony is that Salesforce actually markets itself on the idea of the ""Customer 360,"" but as you experienced, that technology is at its best when it's a tool in the hands of a capable human. The software likely gave that agent your history and technical specs instantly, but it was the agent who provided the empathy and the ""very, very good"" interaction that actually solved your problem.
​It’s a grounded perspective—technology should support the human experience, not try to replace it.",positive

Nonetheless, expert systems are very powerful and since they are not general purpose, much less work is done to make them better. 

ChatGPT may not be good at the game Go because it’s a general purpose smart system, but alpha go, an expert system trained to beat the best go player will win everyone

- It sometimes completely forgets about the most fundamental thing there is (like the sun intensity per latitude per season)
- If you keep using it for adjustments, it tends to add more and more, and basically never removes something. Sometimes it does adjust something though.

So my conclusion for now is:
- You, as a person, are the main engineer, who needs to have full understanding of every detail of the project
- The AI can be asked for advice, asked for analysis of data, asked to implement something

The difference is that it is now effecting graduate jobs instead of just manual labor. E.g. 1st to 5th year law jobs are vanishing entirely as AI does legal discovery and other work new lawyers did previously.

AI does not need to do your job perfectly to replace you. Or even as well. It just needs to be satisfactory for business. Lower quality is often acceptable if they save millions on salaries.

I believe AI is merely speeding up repetitious tasks at the moment, even if that means conducting vital medical research, not replacing the researchers.

I just urge consumers to get their act together and understand proper use of AI as an improvement tool, just like other tech products in the market.

Ohhh, and I use AI to refine my product plan before diving into the code instead of telling AI to code.

1. In a lot of cases AI are trained on human input, meaning they're trained to reach human level performance, not necessarily to reach top level performance.
2. I'm pretty sure AI follows something analogous to the power law of practice, where progress plateaus near their maximum potential.
3. AI doesn't have to ""beat"" human performance to be ready for the real world —even if they're half as good, companies will be more than happy to replace us to not have to pay a salary.
4. I don't think AI's ability to perform is as strongly tied their ability to reason as most people assume. We're just starting to learn how to integrate it properly and find good use cases.

Even if we make zero progress on the models themselves, I could easily see us reaching those 30% from improved integration and by increasing the quality of the training-data.

"This video is giving people the wrong kind of comfort.

The real point was never “AI will replace every job tomorrow.” A job is made up of many tasks. AI is starting to handle more of those tasks, and that share is growing fast. Even if a human still has to supervise, the result is fewer people needed and fewer hours needed. That means job loss and wage pressure without full replacement.

Second, the AI that eats your job won’t be a standalone model in a chat box. It’ll be a full system built from multiple models plus tools, workflows, memory, and context. That “agent” layer is improving insanely fast, and it’s the part this video barely touches.

So yes, AI might not be perfect today. But the speed is the whole issue. Videos like this can lull us into thinking we have plenty of time, when we should be preparing right now for a societal shift that’s going to hit hard.

Also, small irony, the video misspells “failure.”",positive
"The Musk quote at the start (""In the absence of AI and robotics...we are actually totally screwed."") maybe out of context but also shows out of touch these guys can be.

A lot of normal, everyday people are not ""...actually totally screwed"". Maybe in context, Musk is talking about accomplishing specific with AI and robotics but for a lot of people it does nothing for them.

If AI and robotics were accomplishing new work, better work, at reasonable scale and price then they would have a product to sell. Right now these guys do not and neither does a ""$1,000,000 vacuum"". Being able to run a local (ie. DO NOT CALL THE DATA CENTER) AI is feasible but it needs to run fast on ""moderate, mobile hardware"". When that happens, now we are talking more like a ""$1,000 vacuum"" and that is actually usable by a lot of people.

"For my philosophy nerds out there:  John Searle was 100% right.  

For those who aren't philosophy nerds:  (this is a rough and broad analysis, but good enough for the comment section of YouTube) The famous Turing Test, from the equally famous Alan Turning, posited that if someone spoke to an unknown ""person"", and could not discern which answers were from a human, and which from a computer, then that computer is ""intelligent"".  John Searle criticized this, by positing the ""Chinese Room"" thought experiment. In this room sits a man who speaks only English, but is given a very large book with a set of instructions of how to translate various Chinese symbols it receives as input, into a specific output.  He claimed that the man in the room has no actual intelligence in regards to what is coming in, nor going out.  He simply knows his instructions, and follows them.  He is engaging in mindless symbol manipulation, nothing more.  However, to the hypothetical Chinese speaker on the outside, it seems as though the Chinese Room is an intelligent being.  They are able to have conversations,  ask detailed questions, ask for advice, and get convincing answers.  We're seeing exactly this with the current iteration of AI.  It has no intelligence, understands neither what it is being asked, nor what it produces, which is why it consistently makes illegal moves in Chess, despite Chess being highly regimented with specific rules, that even an amateur could figure out how not to make such illegal moves.  

John Searle was 100% right in his critique of the Turing Test as the test of artificial intelligence, and we're seeing it play out live.",negative

"Interesting, but I have to doubt the claim that AI is good in image generation. As we have seen in recent months from marketing material etc, AI generated contents are immediately recognized as such and often have embarrassing problems that professionally created human content would not have.
One very recent example would be the olympic games where they generated some images containing errors in the official logo. Or a marketing video of a wrestling organization where their guy is wearing a belt with their competitor's logo. Those were officially published without anyone even checking apparently.
Saying the tech is on par with humans when you lower the quality standards is a bit questionable imo. I have experimented with image generation myself and none of the ""usable"" content was ever good enough after the first stage without further modification. With videos it's probably hopeless, though the cost difference there is so big for short clips that it might not matter.",negative

"We are decision engines. Our brains have a lot of biological similarities to what's being done in code and silicon today. Whole discussions of consciousness come into play. But what LLMs lack today - for all their similarities - is the ability to persist, stop/pause, think, rethink, before writing a single word.

At least a few dramatic optimizations can be made:
(1) the LLMs of today scan the entire context in the effort to determine the next word (or ""stop""); this architecture is a very clever and arguably ""thinking"" language engine but it's grossly inefficient. We think with subject/attention focus first, we can pause and think, re-read and backspace (though we can't do that in spoken word, we can pause, think, and speak a correction). LLMs can't pause and think (although they can break a large task into multiple ""thinking"" chunks - still the same engine), they can't backspace.
(2) The entire architecture lives in digital precision but it wants to exist in a world of analog fuzziness. Billions or trillions of math operations are performed with flawless accuracy within a digital system that is incapable of producing error - yet the model itself is built on error and fuzziness and produces error after error as a result. Analog technology needs to find its way into this space. Our brains are analog. The weights and models are analog. Why is the processing being done with digital accuracy?

When you see a red ball, your brain runs visual processing → object recognition → semantic memory → contextual evaluation → THEN language (if even, cause you're not a walking comic book to say out loud what you see or think). LLMs skip all that and just predict ""red ball"" because those words appeared together in training data. Testing LLMs on non-language tasks is like testing a speaker's ability to compose music. You're measuring the output device, not the intelligence system. This study conflates one narrow tool with all of AI.

"I said this about self driving, but applies equally here. Theres an unwritten 80/20 rule with any form of computer intelligence.

80% oif any human task is easier than you think. 20% actually requires thinking and creativity. AI will get rapidly better when it's still in that first 80% and it seems like it'll be able to do anything, but then once it hits that last 20% it completely plateaus and cannot get any better. 

AI doesn't think, it doesnt understand and it cannot create. It mimics based on our inputs. And it can mimic really well. But you can only get so far by copying.

Self-driving hit this a few years ago. Its why waymo had to resort to having people remotely operate the cars in any unusual situation. It just cant get any better. LLMs hit this wall as well, newer versions are not noticeably better than previous versions and in many ways seem to be getting worse. Image and video generation is going to hit that wall very soon as well. we really are kind of at t he edge of what this tech is capable of, and for the most part it still can't do what was promised. Just like full self driving cars still dont exist.

All the big tech CEOs went all in on the tech, expecting that by now it would be so good everything would be done with AI. But now they are panicking as its pretty clear we're at the edge of what it can do and the widespread use cases just arent' materializing.

"One thing to note with AI video - power use for longer clips is exponential, not linear. And it is SO much more intensive than image generation. According to MIT (in May 2025):
One standard quality 1024x1024 image takes about 4,402 joules, the equivalent of running a microwave for 5.5 seconds
One 5 second video clip from a newer model takes 3.4 million joules,  the equivalent of running a microwave for an hour
Your 5 second clip is the equivalent of 1 hour, but a 10 second clip is the equivalent of 4 hours. (Seeing it used for several minutes or even entire videos or movies would be astronomically expensive and it would also still look like shit if you pay attention to any details... And you still have zero control, and will never get it right on the first try, so you'll have to redo it over and over...)

A fun little example MIT gives for energy use for an ""average social media post"" by an AI enthusiast:
""Let’s say you’re running a marathon as a charity runner and organizing a fundraiser to support your cause. You ask an AI model 15 questions about the best way to fundraise. Then you make 10 attempts at an image for your flyer before you get one you are happy with, and three attempts at a five-second video to post on Instagram. You’d use about 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity—enough to ride over 100 miles on an e-bike (or around 10 miles in the average electric vehicle) or run the microwave for over three and a half hours.""

and the way forth, is moving towards AGI, yes is only barely starting, but rather using specific tooling agents with self evaluation steps, and parallel oversight with each part. 

no ,AI aint gonna crash out, from where i am and using, and neither is it doom for al who dont adopt, just less productivity and slower output compared to those with the optimzed tools.

This is more an integration failure but more importantly, it doesn’t mean that 97% of work generated was a throw away failure. Much, if not the vast majority of the output may have been at useful and represented value.

Let’s not forget another few things, the AI available to the public has vast constraints placed upon it and is massively “dumbed down” for “safety”. As well as this, I’d bet that these company’s are at least 12-24 months ahead of the public models in the lab.",positive
Why don't they punish the AI for drawing too much power to complete a task so it forces the neural network to find less resource intensive computational patterns to solve a problem?

"The reason 95% of agents fail might not be the models. It might be LangChain.
Not LangChain specifically — but the abstraction it popularized. Chains. The idea that an agent is a sequence of calls strung together with prompt templates.
Real agent work isn't sequential. It's concurrent. It needs error recovery, state management, persistent memory, and graceful handling of partial failures. Those are operating system problems, not pipeline problems.
We've known how to solve these problems for decades. Process scheduling, memory management, service registries, error handling — UNIX figured this out in the 1970s. But the agent ecosystem skipped all of that and went straight to ""chain some API calls together.""
When agents break, the community response is usually ""try a different prompt"" or ""add another chain."" Nobody asks whether the architecture underneath is wrong.
I've built about 25 MCP servers for my own agent systems. The first thing I learned is that without a shared namespace, a service registry, and proper state management, you end up with a million magic strings and silent failures everywhere. That's not a model problem. That's a systems engineering problem.
The agent ecosystem needs fewer frameworks and more infrastructure. Less chaining, more operating system thinking. The models are good enough. The plumbing isn't.",negative

This includes trials where very specific prompts were given and images were uploaded which should have been too easy to fail. The models still failed and even worse created fake imagery despite being asked to only annotate images which had been uploaded. Despite being a simple task it is still too abstract which is not a strength of AI. I also gave it what I knew was an ‘impossible task’ which any graduate would respond with ‘I need more information’. This is a critical problem with AI, it is incapable of responding with ‘I don’t know or I cannot provide an answer’.

"The counter points to this video is effortless.

1. The Upwork sample is 240 jobs in a few categories, not the entire job market, so you cannot generalize a 96% failure rate to jobs overall.
2. AI + human teams vs AI only is the real baseline. The study and video mostly compare solo AI vs solo human. In practice, the relevant question is human with AI vs human without AI for cost, speed, and quality. Afterall, an AI system that fails as a standalone worker can still be valuable if it drafts, explores options, or automates 60–80% of the grunt work that a human then corrects.
3. Economic value does not require human‑parity quality. A tool can generate large ROI without ever reaching full human parity on most tasks. If the AI tool cuts 30–50% of labor time across millions of workers, it’s economically massive despite failing many head to head comparisons.
4. When corporate AI deployment fails, that says much more about the implementation and change management, not the underlying technology.",negative

"From GPT 5.2 Pro:

That “AI can only automate 2.5% of remote work” headline is the rare stat that’s both true and misleading at the same time. And the paper itself quietly tells you why—if you read past the hype.

What they actually measure is brutally strict: can an agent, end‑to‑end, produce a deliverable a “reasonable client” would accept, compared to a professional human deliverable. Under that definition, frontier agents mostly faceplant; the best system clears only ~2.5% of projects. That’s a valuable reality check on fully autonomous “just give it the files and it ships” fantasies.

But the moment you treat “2.5%” as “2.5% of remote jobs,” the study stops being a measurement and becomes a vibe. The benchmark is pre-filtered in ways that systematically push it away from the most automatable slices of remote work: whole categories are excluded because they’re already easy for AIs (yes, writing/copywriting), and many common remote categories are excluded for practical benchmark reasons (client interaction, teamwork, waiting-for-results work, hard-to-render deliverables). Then add the fact it’s run under specific scaffolds and constraints (including a default one-hour session timeout in their computer-use setup), and you’re not measuring “the economy”—you’re measuring “full autonomy under a narrow lab-compatible definition.”

One more uncomfortable detail: the headline numbers come from a largely private test set; the public release is mainly for qualitative poking, not independent replication at scale. So the paper is asking you to trust the evaluators’ judgment calls on “client-acceptable.”

Verdict: as a stress test of fully autonomous freelancing, it’s solid and sobering. As a general claim about “AI automation of remote work,” it’s overbranded. The real takeaway isn’t “jobs are safe”; it’s “today’s agents are brittle, and the benchmark is designed to expose brittleness.”

⸻

Receipts (for anyone who wants to verify):
They define success as “accepted by a reasonable client” vs the human deliverable.  ￼
They report the best automation rate as 2.5% (Manus), with other agents below that.  ￼
They explicitly exclude content-writing/copywriting categories partly because many are already solvable by AIs, and exclude many other categories (PM, customer service, digital marketing, etc.).  ￼
Computer-use setup runs with a default 1‑hour session timeout.  ￼
They keep a private test set for quantitative evaluation and release a public set; the public set is 10 tasks in the open repo.  ￼",positive

"1. A lot of that comes down to accuracy. Any meaningful work requires multiple steps to complete. Let's assume that LLM gets things right 90% of the time. This means that problem that needs 10 steps to complete will be correct only 34% of the time, 20 steps just 12%, 30 steps just 4%. 
2. If LLMs were really able to ""code autonomously"" and ""replace programmers"", then all those AI companies would be right now bidding for custom software contracts instead of selling access to their models. And they would be making tens of billions in profits instead of losing billions. Same story for most other jobs.",neutral

"AI is costing more than companies thought.  Like for good example, Amazon.  Ordered a bunch of things and it all came in 1 box.  Except for one item that was missing.  Had to chat with the AI bot ( couldn't even get a real person to chat with) to get that missing item but in doing so, it also re-ordered the entire order of the whole box.  Once received, I had to get my one thing out that was missing and ship out the rest.  And it was 3 different shipping lebels too so had to boxed them correctly and drop it off at UPS.  Dumbest thing I ever went through.  Why not just send me the single item that was missing...  So much money could've been saved.  And Amazon just announced big layoffs too so I don't what they're going to do if AI is doing things like this.",negative

Those studies predicted future models accuracy and have been proven correct multiple times.  The training data itself inherently has human error, so the AI error rate is a multitude worse.  If the AIs encounter a unique event or problem not addressed by the training data it will fail almost 100% of the time.

My experience is that Ai is great at writing, hence the term Large Language Model (LLM), but as far as completing tasks and understanding and decision making, it's very poor.  And I think it has actually went downhill this past year, the models I use now seem to be slower at understanding the point and spitting out the correct deliverable as the older ones.  This is mostly used in coding, writing and legal.  It just can't think, it can only repeat what it has seen and it tries to mashup what it has seen, but really can't produce anything new it seems.  Nowadays, it seems like working with Ai is like working with a really lazy employee, they just do the minimum you request, ignore half of what you request and generally waste time until you specifically ask them to complete a task or explain something, etc.  It's quite frustrating to have to spoon feed it specifications/directions and have it spend most of it's time on banter and fluffery to communicate with you than to actually output work.",negative

"This just proves that most are using it wrong. We cannot expect AI to replace decision maker and to be responsible for high stakes tasks.

Here is where is AI is strong. It is master librarian of known human knowledge. We need to focus on cognitive improvement. You can learn anything and tune the delivery of the knowledge to your education level and how you learn. AI is great at research. It is a canvas for creativity and a virtual lab for experimentation. It is a mental growth engine. We can synthesize new understanding, research and breakdown these new understanding to their fundamental truths. We experiment with these new understandings in the real world. Because we are alive, we can exchange our ideas and findings with each other. We can discover together to learn what actually works. We can better direct investments and scale human intelligence.

Using AI to optimize out the human is going to fail like it it is because of one simple thing. WE ARE HUMANS!

Knowledge is human. Economics depend on humans. Everything we do is human. The profiteers need to remove this thinking that AI is this Holy Grail profit engine that will remove the costs and the messy management required to manage a human workforce. Why not use the knowledge to improve the humans working for you? Use the knowledge to change the work culture forge the type of Apple has from its customers. That's the return on ROI. The company uses the knowledge experience of their human workforce and the knowledge of AI to solve problems and improve their bottom line. People are filled with purpose, are a part of the growth engine and compensated well.

Until we rid ourselves of this adversarial mindset that thinks of humans as replaceable and disposable tools to achieve a goal, this is going to fail.

And now a friend of mine has written a paper that further moves the needle forward using a refraction concept where individual nodes in the neural network follow the optical laws of reflection and refraction to pull in context relevant data in addition to the weights that govern how a given neural network will behave. Combined with a hybrid heuristics model this is the way to go. And also I will add that I did build a business around a QA testing automation framework system for enterprise businesses that can and does solve the whole vibe coding problems, estimated value of $11M, built by spending $1.1M of my own money. The trouble is that everyone is so caught up in the insane hype cycle that nobody cares when I publish stuff, nobody pays any attention, nobody even  gives me the time of day.

"Interesting. Most people (a lot of people) judge AI and its outputs based on their experience using free tier models. Is anyone in the comments section paying $500+/month for access to a model? Multiple models? Is anyone using agents? Set-up multiple clusters? How much money has been spent on compute time? Are they just using SAAS that has added AI to their name? Fair to say that the general baseline for most people is running free AI apps on their phone or as a tab in their browser. Perspective matters. Like most research, it’s often viewed in isolation and leveraged to back a position. Perhaps it would be more interesting to look at a range of research, a range of methodologies, synthesise the findings to establish a broader position. While AI has started to disrupt tasks and functions across the workforce, in varying degrees across disciplines, it hasn’t replaced ‘jobs’. Is it rapidly replacing ‘work’ though? In some cases yes, and others not so much. One way to perhaps measure this is to look at graduate or junior ‘roles’. Are they still as available at the same scale as they once were? Are junior ‘tasks’ being disrupted? How and when will we see this pattern scale (will we see it scale or plateau?). ColdFusion has done a great job starting the conversation with this, but it would be good to look at AI more broadly - free models, paid models, agents etc and work more broadly - tasks, functions, roles, jobs. Rolling everything up into simple terms like ‘AI’ and ‘jobs’ is one thing, but when both are so nuanced there’s a bit more to the story to tell.",positive

It is quite interesting to see that it sometimes does really well and then sometimes it fails miserably at problems that an intern could solve.

A simple check in the documentation of the new version immediately solved the problem - an intern could do that.
Nevertheless, I feel way more productive with the coding agents as it eliminates a lot of writing boilerplate code.

I am wondering though, when github and more generally the internet becomes filled more and more with AI generated code, how will the new models be trained to adopt newer concepts and does not gravitate to the old concepts that is more deeply embedded in its training data.

There are a lot of small companies with no risk, and for a moment their logo doesn't matter at all but down the road it can bite them in the ass and they'll have to re-design it meaning they'll have to change a logo on physical prints and buildings and ads and their office doors.

"Curious how they tell the agents to go about the tasks. It feels like many agentic frameworks are currently lacking some fundamental steps in their process to ensure high quality. So, as it stands, you need to explicitly prompt the AI tools with these missing steps. The agents are getting better at this, but it boils down to: are the requirements complete and do they make sense and not conflict? If not, follow up is needed. Are the requests achievable by the AI? E.g do they have access to the correct commands and programs for the job, and does that program have sufficient API driven access for the AI tool to interact with it? If not, then it will struggle to meet the requirements. Is there a mechanism by which the AI tool can validate its work? If yes, does the AI tool have the ability to iterate on the work until the various requirements are met? Finally, does the AI have the capacity to validate all the requirements are met without conflict, and iteratively improve until it’s done?
Many of these steps are missing in current tools unless explicitly prompted and setup.

It’s fascinating about the example given about different angles, but all the furniture is shuffled around. My guess is that all of the following is true: there was no explicit requirement that the furniture doesn’t move around; the tool used was image generation rather than 3D model generation which allows camera angle to shift; there were ineffective feedback looks to validate the work against the requirements.

So I would judge that 4% to be a lower bound success rate when the AI tool isn’t sufficiently set up with the right tools and prompted with the right workflows. Sure that’s pretty bad, but I think with access to the correct tools of the trade, and correct processes followed, the success rates would be a lot higher.",positive

2. They tested AI's specifically in areas where we all know AI's can't perform detailed work well without many iterations. Video, Animation, 3D modeling, graphics design, game development, audio design and product design were just some of the tasks the choose to compare perofrmance on. 

This is so stupid that I almost think they must have done this on purpose. If their goal was to really check how many jobs that will be displaced by AI they could have just set up a test. 1 programmer using Claude Code 4.6 vs 2-4-6-8-10 programmers writing code manually. That would actually have been interesting and I would bet 1 programmer with claude 4.6 could easily outperform 6-8 programmers with no issue.",negative

"Here is the thing: Ai is here to stay, but like many other trends in the last years, it won’t revolutionize our world directly (remember 3d printing, Crypto?). 

The problem is not, that Ai, just suck - but that the companies suck. They thought that they can shortcut the whole development. At this point, most consumer Ai solutions are based on a chatbot. Think about a person, who is really a great conversationist - who has an amazing overall knowledge of the world (...), would you give him/her your car to repair? Or would you want to be your surgeon? 

To feed chatbots more and more will not solve the issue (yet the Ai companies are spending more and more time and money to find further shortcuts). The problem is, that the chatbots are not coming to conclusions because of their understanding of things - but because things are correlated to each other. This is not the same thing. 

I am absolutely not surprised about the result. It is extremely frustrating, to use Ai - if you have got a specific outcome in mind. Sure - if you are playing with it, it is surprisingly convincing.

Let us just take creating a picture: Ai is not able to create a series of pictures (or videos) which are consistent. Ai will probably not in the next year be able to make a good comic. Because it is always inconsistent. And even if they are “training” the ai so far, that it can do it, it won’t be excellent.

Here is the point: they want to cheat the development steps - and want, that Ai can do everything at once. It would be far better (and useful), if Ai could do smaller things flawlessly (and does only that what you tell it to do).",positive

"A lot to say there. I am in the Internet, Webdesign, Coding Space for 30 years. The stuff AI can do today is mindbending, and i on it since the gpt2 or so. The rate of improvement and new discovery is still exponational. As a tool it is 95% there to replace someone i would hire for. The age of agents just started baerly. We are in the 1998 or so with AI now as the internet started. There will be flops, there will be bubble, and risks and viruses and other more critical things, but i think not so hard as the hole internet bubble was. It will shape the world in a totaly other direction, as the internet also did. And i think it is a good thing, mostly. But the problem is the speed. People can not or are not willing to addept so fast. And business and goverments are slow by default. The conversion of so many technologies together speed all of this up even more. Before most of the ""normal"" people that are not in the space are ready to adopt some of it. They will be totally out of there mind, when car drive themself and Robots do most of the work. And that is coming, and fast. Slow at first and then Boom. Total industrie disruption everywhere. Where needs a roomba when your robot can use your standard vacumcleaner anyway. And there will be stupid things, like a AI toothbrush, a AI dishwasher etc. but these things will be absolete when robotics come around and this will be even faster, because convertions. The AI that will understand the world, his user, the risks etc. etc. will be there and just need better mechanics and engeneering mostly for some tasks. And parallel all the things we need for that, like materials, sensors, chips, energy usw. will be researched by the none body AI and maybe humans in the loop. But it will happend. And if this real live data of this humanoid robots will be used to learn again for more AI, it will be a flywheel. I don't see any plateau for the next 10-15 years for that tech. Maybe something bad things or horrible will happend. That could  always be the case with new technoligy, but even then, i guess the progress is not stoppable anymore. The next 10-15 years will be wild, scary, hopefull and axyting. I hope for the best. Lets make lifes better first. And with this tech we have a change.

Also, this is a cycle driven by hype. If you have been around, you remember the blockchain cycle, the cryptocurrency, and the pandemic cycle, etc., etc.

Also, all of those CEOs who fired their employee becasue of AI were really short-sighted, but once againg f yu have been in this business space, you know this cycle is basically their management skill; they fire people all the time, it's worse in gaming companies.

Also soemting else, AI shouldn't be shoved into every sector, infact AI has no place in health care, at least at its current iteration, because hallucination is a huge problem.

What Yann is saying, just so we are clear for anyone who may be confused, is that LLM's *do not have the capability* to be a human level intelligence because of what an LLM *is.* The way an LLM simulates intelligence precludes it from the ability to actually have intelligence. The only way to get to actual human-level intelligence in a machine in some way involve an LLM, but it is not an LLM itself.

"People saying LLMs will replace any significant amount of work are definitely doomers. But saying they are overall bad because they fail at a big chunk of ""human tasks"" is also overlooking a lot. 
If you give LLMs a task that is in the right format, so primarily text based, especially for output, and give it the right tools for the job, it can do quite impressive and very useful things. This is very clear when looking at software development. A LLMs can just ingest an entire codebase in a few minutes and start expanding or improving it. But this requires clear instructions from a person that also understands the code base at a solid level. 

Other areas are tasks that are primarily browser based or ""data entry jobs"" where people just repetitively extract data from some documents or one tool, to then put it in another tool. I have one of those jobs as a working student and I am already starting to automate parts of my work using LLMs (so far primarily to create code that then does the task). All my day to day tasks are easily replaceable by AI or AI generated tools, obviously with strict controls in place. On prototypes I created for my work I achieved  a success rate well above 90%. The last few percent are edge cases most of the time or just someone else messing up their work before it got to me.",positive

Heck, thanks to AI the other day I managed to solve a bureaucratic issue that there is no coherent information about elsewhere, and would have otherwise cost me thousands of euros and lots of wasted time. I'm not going to claim LLMs are perfect, they're not, but they're definitely solving some things, and solving them fast, much faster than humans, which gives us the space to deal with more interesting things. I see this in my job as well as a software engineer. I am a staff engineer which means that comparatively I have a lot less time to work on actual coding tasks than senior engineers. Traditionally I would deliver 1-3 PRs a week. Now I have days when I submit 3-4 PRs in a single day. Valid code, passing tests, all that jazz. This has enabled me to pay more attention to everything else I am doing, to work on other initiatives, to hold workshops, knowledge-sharing sessions, be more in the loop with what other teams are doing, react faster to questions from my peers.

"LeCun is correct, but what he thinks we need, is far beyond what we actually need. I know world models and RL agents will be better than LLMs for physical world and around the corner (out of distribution cases). Remember 98% of work is sub PhD/doctorate of all kinds. All an agent and or LLM is, is an employee. Hire a human being, then give them a simple basic one line task to do. Then grade them based on the results without asking for any changes, edits, etc. LLMs and agents need process, skill, knowledge, fine tuning, scaffolding, and cyclical passes. All humans first pass or even few passes, are trash. This is where the disconnect is. It is a brain. It is like a human. It is the approach and expectation that is ridiculous and delusional. Studying, corporate work, anything is all SOPs, years of processes and standards and thousands of passes and decisions and training and experience. Thinking that LLMs are the problem is like thinking humans got to where we are without centuries of inventions, knowledge, innovations, learning (20 years then learning skills and processes for 2-5 years and bosses training and giving advice, feedback, examples, rounds of verifications). I laugh at how stupid people are at this. Stop thinking any human employee is going to get even 0.0000000001% score with what your providing an LLM.",positive

For mental labor, it can think continuously, without distraction, breaks, rest, getting sick, pregnant, et cetera. Even if, by some standard, it worked less than efficiently than a human -- it works for longer and for cheaper -- ultimately being more cost effective

If following the trend of continuously getting about twice as good every 6 months, that leaves us at over 100% in just 3 years from now

"Short, grounded summary (what the video is saying):
The video argues that recent research showing “AI fails at 96% of jobs” is widely misunderstood. The cited studies do not mean AI is incapable; rather, they show that most real-world deployments or pilots fail to deliver measurable impact, mainly because organisations integrate the technology poorly, lack workflow redesign, or expect unrealistic results too quickly. 
It also emphasizes a broader pattern: headlines about automation often exaggerate immediate job replacement, while the reality is slower—AI tends to augment specific tasks first, and only later reshape whole roles. Some labour-market studies even show little evidence yet of major job displacement from generative AI so far. 
Plain meaning:
The “96% failure” framing is mostly about implementation failure, not capability failure. The tools can work, but most organisations still don’t know how to use them effectively. Over time, that gap tends to close — which is when real transformation usually happens.
If you want, I can give you the strongest opposing interpretation of the same evidence (the pessimistic vs. optimistic readings), because this topic is a classic case where both sides read the same data very differently.",neutral

If AI can be used for specific tasks then those tasks it is used for successfully will be replacing jobs. It won't replace whole jobs one by one, it will replace single tasks one by one.
As a programmer I use AI extensively. Initially, AI was auto-completion of single words (that has been available in good IDEs for decades). Then LLMs started to allow auto completion of lines. Then multiline competitions. Then large sections of boilerplate code. Now it can generate whole functions or work on whole projects. It still needs guidance and often needs corrections and manual interventions, but it is an undeniable fact that it is already replacing jobs as the people who use it well can produce code faster. But the reality is that writing code is actually are relatively small proportion of most software development so the number of jobs lost may not be as large as you might think. But the idea that an AI must do a complete persons job without fail before it can take jobs is just plain stupid.",negative

"I read the comments and it seems crazy to me that people think, “Oh, just 4%… pff, I was scared I should worry. Now I feel safe.” Even with numbers that low, do you know how many people that 4% represents worldwide?

And by the way, I read the study. It includes tasks we already know AI is not great at yet. Still, 4% of jobs performed at least as well as a human by a technology that, four years ago, was basically a joke is already something to worry about. Even if it takes 10 or 20 years to add another 10%, that will have a huge impact on society.

Also, many of these jobs are not like “digging a hole”, where of course we’ve had tools that can do it better than us for decades. We’re talking about jobs that used to require an actual human brain. And even if they still need supervision, how many supervisors will companies really need? The full current workforce? Yeah, right.

And yes, it’s not surprising that early adopters are the ones running into all the issues first. That’s what happens with pretty much every new technology. The first wave finds the bugs, the edge cases, the failures, the weird limitations. But that doesn’t mean the technology won’t get better. It usually means the opposite, those issues become the roadmap for the next improvements.

And before you tell me I’m an AI fanboy, believe me, I know how much crap these systems still produce and how much fixing they require. Thank God for that!. But I’d be blind not to recognize how fast they’re improving, especially in certain tasks like programming. They keep getting better and better: from a few lines of code four years ago to huge codebases today. And I’m not talking about “vibe coding”. If you haven’t used the most recent models, less than six months old, for coding, you don’t know what you’re talking about.

Combine that with increasing visual capabilities and systems that can review their own output and fix what’s actually wrong, instead of rewriting everything and creating even more mess like before, and the trend is obvious. Yes, they’re weak at some tasks because they’re still, fundamentally, next-token predictors. But what I’m seeing is that large models are relying more and more on what they’re best at: generating code to solve the task they were given. Code they can run, inspect the results of, and improve from there.

And one more thing. When people say, “AI has been overhyped before, those old claims were wrong”, think again. Maybe the claims weren’t wrong, maybe the timing was way off. The people who built the early foundations, the perceptron, then neural networks, and all the work that followed, were basically pointing in the right direction. That line of ideas is the backbone of what we’re using now. I’m oversimplifying, of course, but the foundations are the foundations. What they got wrong wasn’t the direction, it was when we would finally have enough compute and enough data to train systems that actually work. Now we do, and this is exactly the kind of technology that starts replacing what humans used to do.

People assume that because AI doesn’t think like us, or doesn’t “truly understand the world”, or because we’ll hit some mystical “wall”, we’re all safe. I don’t buy it. Do you really think you need deep “world understanding” to replace most people’s work? Come on. I have very competent friends who do their jobs perfectly well without a deep understanding of “the world”.

And even if companies hit limits on training data or energy for bigger datacenters, this is still the infancy of the technology. There’s so much they can do to improve it even within current constraints.

So, yeah. “4%”. Ha. If I weren’t close to retirement, I’d be scared as hell.",positive

Speed is also considered in the paper.

The numbers: human professionals took a median of 11.5 hours (mean 28.9 hours) per project. AI agents operated within a 1-hour session timeout and cost a median of $0.92 per run. So you're looking at roughly a 10-50x speed advantage for AI, even when the output is rejected.

Another less fundamental flaw is that they used humans to evaluate whether AI did a better job than a human in a non-blind setting, so human raters would unavoidably be biased.

Finally, the definition of AI failure as the quality of its deliverables being lower than that of a human worker is doubtful.

"The unsolvable gap to ""good enough to trust"" has always seemed obvious to me: Even when humans fail, they do so in ways we (humans) understand and can (sorta) predict, and plan for. AI failures are just mathematically unpredictable in both when and how. And we're never going to close that last 10%.

One thing I've been thinking a lot about is how MUCH of our world - everything about us and our systems, what things mean to us - is not even written down anywhere, and never was. Think about how much goes unsaid in a movie, or conversation between lovers, or The Brothers Karamazov. It's actually the MOST important things that we never say, have never ever written down - because we don't have to, we're all humans, ""you know what I'm talking about"" means something between us. 

It's no wonder these things will never really ""grasp"", they're trained ONLY on the most superficial features of our whole world. It must be like trying to learn math by looking at a list of the operators and a book full of random sums: It never tells you why any of this, and why this way.

Even at the time, it was clear to me that while they'll be useful for some things, the technology fundamentally is not and cannot become intelligent. Years ago, I was making the argument that people simply think it's intelligent because it can talk. I'm glad to see people are finally starting to understand this. 

Replacing 4% of human work would be very impressive if it wasn't at the cost of several years of societal development and innovation. The largest tech firms in the world have essentially done nothing useful to the average person--or the majority of businesses-- in a good three or four years, meanwhile their core products have not only stagnated but in many cases regressed, largely because of forced AI integration.",positive

I would guesstimate that, when I take in all factors, AI has been something like a ~10% boost in my productivity. The funny thing is, that's a pretty big deal - you've made a very expensive and time consuming process (i.e., writing computer code) 10% more efficient. That is a not insignificant W. The problem is, no one is selling a 10% productivity boost. They are promising 10x. They're not going to get it, nor anything like it, for the forseeable future. And, keep in mind that all of these comments apply within a problem domain (i.e., creating computer code) that AI is actually kinda sorta good at.

Where AI takes jobs is in making productivity astronomically high that a software engineer with AI as its 4th and 5th or even 6th arm, if you may, can do the job of 5 Engineers. That is where jobs are lost. I say this from personal Experience. Using Claude code, I am able to produce good quality code more than 10x my productivity before.

Claude, for instance, was improving at a weekly pace. In 6-12 months, my projection is that it's going to have improved by a huge margin.

The extrapolation from specific Upwork freelance tasks to '96% of all jobs' is a significant logical leap that ignores internal corporate context. Furthermore, linking Microsoft's software quality issues directly to their 30% AI-generated code is speculative correlation rather than proven causation.

"The issue is that so many people believe that when they say AI will replace jobs, that they mean that AI will literally do the work of humans as a one for one replacement, when in reality it's just a tool. Even many experts drink this kool aid perpetuating the problem. But frankly, modern and near future AI has less in common with Commander Data and more in common with the mechanical spinner. The mechanical spinner destroyed millions of jobs, because as a tool, it could do the job of a dozen with only one operator. But it still needed someone to do the work of operating and overseeing it. It's the same with how the digital calculator had replaced the job actually called calculator. One object had made an entire profession obsolete, not to mention massively reducing the number of jobs in similar fields like accounting, but it by itself could do nothing without someone to work the tool.

AI is the same in that regard, with the added bonus that we don't really understand what its good at doing and what it's bad at doing. It's a general purpose tool that is getting better faster than we can deploy it in effective ways, so many people are throwing it at problems and just hoping that it'll be able to solve them. Even worse, do the work with minimal supervision. It's like buying a box of pocket calculators and firing your entire accounting department, then wondering why you're getting notified of a tax audit a few months later.

What AI is amazing at, is reducing the number of people needed to do a task, not erasing entire departments. The very idea that you can just give it a like some outside contractor and expect actual results is like buying a life-sized barbie doll because it vaguely has the same form factor as a human, and expecting it to do the job of a stewardess because you can put on the same uniform onto it. It is a tool, the most powerful tool humanity has ever created, but still just a tool, and is useless without a trained person to operate it, just like how you don't expect a stack of legal documents to represent you in court without a fully trained lawyer to use those documents to present a case.",positive

"I work in the theme entertainment industry (think: theme parks, live shows, TV, etc) doing art, design, illustrations, graphics, marketing. I'm an independent contractor. For YEARS now, I've been screaming that all these A.I. models did, was make my job HARDER. I could see a couple of years ago how the bosses got excited at the idea of having these bots do the art work and design much faster, and I've seen a couple of studio cut their art departments in half, or force every artist to learn one of these models, thinking they could save money and time. 
Instead what has happened is, I've spent a lot of time FIXING what these A.I. models did. They don't understand the nuances of design. These models aren't smart enough to comprehend when something can be built or not, what are material limitations, fabrication limitations, cost! or what is straight up just a copy of something else. I very quickly realized that my job security was guaranteed. They are not gonna take my job because what I do requires actual intelligence. At best, what these models can provide are ""assets"" to use in art work (like textures, small elements such as a bird flying in the sky, or generate images of generic people walking around, that are often used in theme park art). Or, they can maybe generate inspiration material for a mood board or a presentation. But nothing that actually needs to be built or fabricated.
They're basically an expansion of a Google search. Except, one that ALWAYS needs some fixing. 
These past couple of years have been quite annoying because  A.I. always makes my life more difficult. It can not match the skill or experience of a true designer/architect/artist much less come up with something new and original. I think my industry has finally accepted this, at least at the ground level, and these days I rarely have to spent a week fixing a piece of art that ChatGP puked out in 3 seconds, only because the bosses though that ""it looks cool""

"Current AI hallucinates at 4%. Here's how the Luddites created that lie in their ""new study"":
- You submit one single request to an AI. That's a 96% chance of success.
- But ""jobs"" require multiple requests from the AI to complete.
- So let's say your job required two requests from the AI. That's no longer a 96% chance of success. It's 92.16%
- Add a third request from the AI, that's an 88.47% chance of success.
- At 10 requests, that's 66.5%
- At 20 requests, that's 44.2%
- If we keep going, a computer program (and I know this from experience) takes at least 80 requests if you're #VibeCoding.
- At 80 requests of un-monitored, unchecked code, the success rate is a theoretical 3.8%.

That's the lie. If a lazy person offered the AI zero feedback or code supervision, then mathematically speaking 24/25 projects should die. And, of course they would. Never mind that fact that 4% of all projects succeeding is about what humans can accomplish on their own. How many restaurants die in the first year? Look it up.

1) They excluded writing, marketing, and copywriting — literally the categories where AI is already eating freelancers' lunch. Then they acted shocked AI scored low.
2) The benchmark is 60%+ video, 3D CAD, architecture, and game dev. Try asking a human to do those jobs with nothing but a terminal and a 1-hour time limit. That's what the AI got.
3) ""Automation rate"" is pure pass/fail. An agent that nails 90% of the brief but exports the wrong file format scores the same as one that outputs garbage. Many failures were literally just corrupted files and missing assets — tooling problems, not intelligence problems.
4) 240 projects across 23 of 64 job categories. That's not ""remote work."" That's a very specific slice of freelance gig work deliberately weighted toward AI's blind spots.
5) Humans used Blender, AutoCAD, Adobe Suite with years of expertise. The AI got a basic CLI and like three API tools. Then the paper concluded AI can't do the work. Yeah no kidding.

I think the world is lost because this critical reference was missing from a 1997 master student thesis:

""Adaptive Control: Stability, Convergence, and Robustness"" by Shanker Sastry and Marc Bodson (1989)

Please see the talk ""Shades of Reinforcement Learning"" by Dr. John Tsitsiklis from MIT on YouTube.

I think what happened is they copied code in the back of a 150 page thesis and forgot where it came from and why it was designed this way (the student applied adaptive control in the paper 🖇️ code but did not discuss adaptive control systems in the text, and he left the infinite Fuzzy state space normalized on page 127 after the clustering, it needed to be de-normalized, those are the ""attention heads"" that were copied, even though they were called control node centers, really like a perceptual control system, much like how we control our eyes to track our hands or to track objects).

"The companies expecting AI to just replace everyone are delusional, at least for now and barring some very large breakthroughs. AI can produce decent results, but it takes a lot of effort and understanding of how they work to do it. I've used them for code. For production code at work I don't vibe code anything, I use it as a simple tool for very specific tasks. But I have vibe coded stuff just on the side (for myself) for fun to see how it does. The difference in code quality between spending 5 minutes prompting it to make something that's a few thousand lines of code, and spending a few hours working with it to create a detailed plan and specification sheet is high. I'm not saying the AI did either as good as a dev, but you can definitely get _better_ results by spending a lot of time planning out the specs and what exactly you want, the plan it needs to follow, splitting it out into granular tasks to manage context rot, outlining how it needs to make unit tests, ensuring that you manage the unit testing in a way that they aren't biased to false success because the agent that wrote the code implementation also went and wrote a biased unit test that works for it, etc.

To properly setup an ""agent"" to do anything requires good tooling, good harnesses around it, good instructions, good planning, a good idea of what you actually want. There's no way you're getting full automation without some one at least guiding it, and even then it's only good for specific things. Bob in accounting is not likely going to be able to guide any LLM into making good reports because in my experience most of the time he fundamentally doesn't understand even what data he wants, what edge cases in the data he has to account for, etc.

Companies trying to shove it into everything possible are trying to cash in on the hype and it's going to backfire on them, and hurt a ton of people in the process and when the bubble pops. Like you said, it takes proper setup, and none of these companies are doing that because all they care about is the hype and they fundamentally don't understand the technology.",positive

"A new Remote Labor Index study compared leading AI models directly against humans on 240 real Upwork freelance jobs, averaging 630 dollars each, across design, video, coding, and other computer-based tasks.
​

The best model, Claude Opus 4.5, produced client-acceptable work only 3.75% of the time, implying a 96.25% failure rate, while Gemini achieved just 1.25%.
​

Failure meant the AI did not reach human professional quality, with four main issues: corrupt/empty or unusable files, incomplete work, poor quality even when complete, and internal inconsistencies in outputs.
​

AIs tended to succeed more in narrow areas like creative ideas for audio/image work, ad/logo concepts, writing and reports, data retrieval/web scraping, and simple interactive data visualizations.
​

The video argues that current benchmarks overstate AI capability because they are synthetic; on this real-work RLI benchmark, state-of-the-art agents “perform near the floor.”
​

Corporate adoption often fails because executives push AI without structured implementation or understanding of its limits; a PWC report is cited saying most CEOs see no clear financial returns yet.
​

Gartner is cited predicting that by next year about half of companies that fired workers for AI will end up rehiring them, reflecting disappointment with practical performance.
​

Examples from Microsoft’s increased AI-generated code and FDA-reported AI failures in medicine (including surgical errors) are used to show risks of overreliance in critical systems.
​

The creator and quoted experts argue current large language model–based systems are powerful tools but not genuinely intelligent, face scaling limits, and are being overhyped by investors and paid influencers.
​

Overall, the episode concludes that AI will transform the world in the long run, but today it is best viewed as a helper that can ease certain tasks, not a near-term replacement for most human jobs or a guarantee of huge profits.

4. Not all jobs are equally good candidates. LLMs are best at communication, second best at coding, so that's where you start. And of course go for the easiest and least critical jobs first.
5. AI is improving extremely fast. If something doesn't work well now, just wait a few months and try again.
6. What you see is at least a generation behind what the big boys are playing with. They have a pretty good idea what will be released in a year, while you'll be shocked again tomorrow.
7. AI is also coming to the real world. It's already there in Tesla's robotaxi. You should really check it out. Then there are the humanoid robots that are also improving fast. In a year or two they'll be doing useful work.
8. Also play with xAI's video generator. It has a level of understanding of the world that's almost scary. Not perfect yet, but far better an it has any right to be. Sometimes it feels like the characters it makes are actually conscious. Don't describe what should happen, just set the scene, and let the AI control the characters. In fact, if you make them do something a human wouldn't want, they sometimes seem to suffer.
9. Yann LeCun is a joke at this point, he went off the rails a few years ago.",positive
"""Is AI ready to replace a person?"" Right now it clearly is not. AI enables you to do the work of 5 people? But, were you going to hire four people? This why ""super powers"" is perhaps a more useful frame than ""they're taking our jobs.""

AI can paint a picture, but it's not going to paint a masterpiece. If you need a masterpiece, you need a person. But often, you don't. Often, slop is good enough. However, doing things really fast and needing to find new things to do takes a certain psychic toll. Eventually, superpowers can start to feel like an unexpected serious burden. AI super-powers can lead to a sort of mania.  And perhaps that mania can lead to a kind of depression.

I think if you already think about a task like a business person, AI will often make more sense, but if you think like an artisan, it often will not.  Unfortunately, right now, AI might be more beneficial to a more competitive, adversarial and careless mindset than a meticulous and collaborative mindset. Eventually we may have to learn some new skills about time management and how to focus even more intently, and how to work together instead of always competing. The sphere of what we today think of as ""externalities"" may grow.

The tyranny of economic freedom is something we are already struggling with; this will get worse. The mass unemployment thing seems like a Malthusian thought process that ignores lived experience. I think it will be profitable for most of us. I do worry that we might be better off economically but worse off psychologically, especially for the next few decades while we deal with rapid change and the reorganization of labor.",positive

They are amazing when applied surgically, allowing me to do the planning and large-scale thinking, instructing the LLM to write concise bits of code, or generic boilerplate that is often repeated over thousands of source files in its training data. Even then though, manual corrections are frequently necessary to keep it on the right path, or just when repeated prompts cannot get the damned thing to just do what I want.",positive

Judging AI now and on theses way, is like judging kodak pictures in 1975:

1975 – The Invention
	•	Engineer Steven Sasson designed the very first digital camera prototype at Kodak.
	•	The device weighed approximately 3.6 kg (8 pounds).
	•	Resolution: 0.01 megapixels (100 × 100 pixels).
	•	The image was recorded onto a cassette tape.
	•	It took 23 seconds to capture a single photo.

At the time, Kodak’s management did not truly believe in the technology, as the company’s business model relied heavily on selling photographic film.

"Since the beginning of this product hype, I have corrected anyone saying ""AI"". LLMs will never be AI. They are not built that way and don't have persistence, distillation, or perception, something only a brain can (currently) reproduce. These are next-gen Apple Automistake and that is all. Great for specific tasks, when it works, and terrible for pretty much anything else. Microsoft bet the farm on this to drive consumption and control and now have to make it work no matter what. Their AI Ponzi scheme needs new customers to pay old tech debt. If AI was to work as true AI, some aspects of LLMs could be used but it would be a small portion of the total makeup of a complex system. I have friends who vibe code things for their company and I keep telling them who is going to fix the code in 2 years if no one knows what's in there. Good to have this research and be validated, but when you have already built natural language data query systems (albeit rudimentary) 15 years ago, this just seems like a grift. AI audio is still flat and AI video has uncanny valley, but it has advanced considerably in the past few years. I think that and a few others tasks are going to be the winners and when the dust settles will be a small portion of the market or a small portion of each industry vertical. Could it do my job, maybe parts of it, but I'd like to see AI be as grizzled and surely as I am.",positive

"I'm an online freelancer (video/audio) so I'd like to add my 2 cents to a few points. Yes, my work is superior to AI work in almost every case, but the problem is that people value cheap over good almost every time. The 95% failure rate didn't mean the AI couldn't do the job, it just meant it couldn't do it as well as a person. I lost an important client last year with a few hundred thousand subs on YT who moved their video production ""in house"", meaning they pawned it off on some intern or admin assistant using AI. The quality drop was steep and immediate, but they stuck with it instead of hiring me back. To them, the money saved was worth it. A lot of companies are going to do this. 

Additionally, yes AI does require oversight, but what companies are also finding out is that if you have an American and an Indian both running the same AI model and providing human oversight, the Indian is going to be exponentially cheaper and give you the same results. A win for developing nations, but it means that if you live in a developed, wealthy nation, AI in your job is almost guaranteed to drive your wages down.

"I think AI cannot replace because of two aspects that few people talk about, and you should too:
1) We pay someone to not just do the task, but also to be responsible, in terms of the law and honor a contract
2) AI have to be tools, so they should not have taste or preferences on how they do work, otherwise everybody that uses the same LLM will start outputing the same stuff, and we start losing value because the tool will start to assume and take control of the task. You can clearly see that using Suno to make music, it seems that one can choose lyrics, and style and that's it, no other nuance!
When you ask a human to do a piece of work, the profissional will put a lot of their style, preferences, opinions and previous experiences on top of the assignment.
That's why AI fails the tasks by doing too little, because for an AI do to the same will need a VASTLY larger description! The human professional that can be hold accountable has to put the opinions and preferences on top of the assignment.

2. Ignoring parts of the tasks or prompt is a pro-move in graphic design. Ofc the difference is professional would do it consciously and selectively accounting for what client wants rather than writes. while ai would do it randomly and sometimes get it right or closer to desired output.

Just like you can’t give a calculator to some random person off the street and expect them to be as good as a PhD mathematician. The success of AI still depends enormously on the operator, just like the success of any tool, especially as you reach the frontiers of its capability.

Then keep in mind that it is advancing much, much faster than virtually anyone predicted. This is the worst it will ever be.

"This is all so frustrating. Some headlines say AI will take over the world, it's a threat  to humanity, it can do CEO level shit. Other's say It can't do 95% of Jobs, it's overblown, software sell off.",negative
"We have never been screwed before by not having AI or Robotics. We have been healthy, connected, thriving, prosperous and free. Maybe HE is screwed without this nonsense. We are definitely screwed with it.",positive
"Imho this is an indictment on current LLM platforms not being AGI. AGI will be so much better as it will be the combination of a few different tools, LLMs, world models, agentic design etc",positive
"I think it is extremely difficult to control whether or not the ""humans"" in the experiment were using any AI tools.

Measuring quality in this way is methodologically incompatible with HOW AI is replacing human workers; experts having their productivity accelerated so much that several job openings are closed.

One guy is using AI to do the work of 10 people, while the other 9 look for work and find none.",negative

"The people succeeding are the ones who understand that AI is a tool, not a human replacement. The companies making single task focused AI models are the ones that will last.",positive
"I think companies and investors alike fails to understand that information is a finite resource.
Eventually, all the internet's human-created data will have been used for training.
That day is sooner than most people may think. AI-generated content already makes up as much as a third of the internet, if not even more.",negative
"Like every other evolution, there is a lot of mistakes and development.  Thomas Edison learned 2,000 ways on how not to make an incandescent light bulb before he finally succeeded.

"I heard from an expert in computer science saying ""human only use 10-20 watts of electricity to do the tasks of ai which need electricity to power a whole town, a lake worth of water to cool it down, and enough space to grow enough to feed a town to stored computers. In the end, human will perseverance however changes are coming."" This gave me a bit of hope. But still very scary reality right now.",negative

I works for me .. even for tricky tasks - but it took a bit of practice first.,negative
"The Remote Labor Index approach stands out. Testing AI on actual paid freelance jobs instead of synthetic benchmarks exposes something important: generalization is still fragile. Creative ideation and simple code shine, but consistency and file integrity remain real hurdles.",positive

"Whenever I ask AI for coding advice it's confidently wrong in at least half of the times. I am probably not using the right ""model"" and it's just for fun to me. But when I imagine current professional programmers rely on AI to help them with coding problems, I start to feel sick.",negative
Thumbnail has a typo my brother,neutral
Woot channel confirming my biases!,positive
"AI actively makes my job harder. We now use it for work order NTE delegation and invoice monitoring. It’s wrong on nearly every single invoice and NTE (because all it does is average a data set without nuance).

If I were to go to my boss and tell him the only metric we should look at when approving things is the average of the old; I’d be laughed out of the room 😂.",positive

So picture Scam Altman in a sailor's gob hat as he is the Gilligan who fucked things up for everyone else!,negative
They don't understand how people use ai.Its about context and well defined guardrails I thought we knew this already. The study is measuring LLMs ability to pick up a task at random. That's not the same as a llm embedded in a workflow.,positive
4% are lying,negative
"Yes Ai is a glorified calculator, but it doesn't really matter: if the tool makes you 100's of percent better at your job it's still replacing people (and so is other kinds of automatization)",positive

Companies HR are just too eager to replace humans and focus only on keeping 100% profit margins. Employees using AI to accelerate their work is seen as working faster but earning less,positive
I didn't need a study to tell me Ai sucks at most tasks.,negative
"This tracks with my experience using it everyday.  maybe one day it will replace us, but it's a long way off. It can make some task more efficient but for the most part, it fails constantly.",neutral
So we just need 25x data centers and 25x more expensive water and energy to get it to work. No problem.,positive
"Techbros be like ""We need to sabotage education so AI can start outperforming humans""",negative
"AI is beginning to excel at magnitude levels in coding.  Give that some serious thought. Tell AI what you want your program to accomplish, and it can do it better and faster than a human. It's easy to discount AI because of its clumsy avatars and predictable text, but I don't think that will be the case for long. It's gonna get scary.",positive
"It's just like how robots improved factory output, but they still require humans to program and maintain them.",positive
"This is evolution. We are not the same humans as we were 10,000 years ago, and that is natural. But from the perspective of AI evolution, every step is equivalent to 10,000 years of progress. In this case, within a 5 to 10 year span, AI will not only surpass humanity, it will also pave the way to the frontier of human civilization’s evolution. This is just the beginning.",positive
"The analogy I like to use for AI is special in the newest watchdogs game. There is a mission where there’s a new AI that’s being released and you have to go into it data and it’s similar to a black mirror episode where there’s a house and an entity that is the AI inside of it and it’s programmed to think it’s a good person even though it’s actually acting with its own impunity and your job is to decide if you want to destroy it or release it in theory that isn’t the only way though that is exactly how it’s been developed today and because of that, you should always choose to destroy it, although in an alternative universe, the correct way to use AI would be a sort of C-3PO ideally.",positive

"AI can't even spell something correctly even if you tell it exactly how to spell it, it is stupid.",negative
"Working at an IT company. The very best scenario that AI has helped me is it can summarize and locate if I want to search something on our company's wikipages/documents. But in terms of Analysis, development and testing, it is still human work.",positive

"Artificial intelligence will fail in many jobs, because many businesses don’t actually know what it is their employees do. 

A good employee, will do all the little extras that keep everything running smooth smoothly. These extras are not in the job description.
